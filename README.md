# Government Free and Open Source Software

This is a project to compile a list of the different organizations creating free and open source software designed for state and federal governments and related services. Some of the software is created for government to use, other is software created by civil society to supplment services tradditional provided by government or directly related to unique government functions. This is not intended to be a list of software that is designed for general use and might happen to be useful for governments.
